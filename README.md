# Simple Print Scripts

This repository contains two minimal Python scripts that demonstrate how to print messages to the console. They are intended as a quick sanity check that your Python runtime is working or as a starting point for experimenting with simple scripts.

## Repository Contents

- `test.py` – Prints a short alert-style message.
- `test2.py` – Prints an encouraging message.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the source files.
2. Run either script from the command line:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python test2.py
   ```

Feel free to modify the messages in either script to experiment with Python's `print` function or to create quick command-line prototypes.
